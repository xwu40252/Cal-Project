- average%error vs time.py: Calculates the average percentage error between the queue length distributions of estimated data and simulated data and plots it over time.

- error.py: Calculate the percentage error between the queue length distributions of estimated data and simulated data over time for different VISSIM models (oversaturated, CS = 0.95, CS = 0.7, CS = 0.3).

- estimateddata.py: Calculate the trend in maximum queue length over time for different CS values based on estimated data.

- queuelength.py: Simulate the trend in queue length under traffic signal control (estimated data) and compares it with the actual measured data (simulated data), plotting the queue length over time for both.

- simulateddata.py: Calculate the change in maximum queue length over time for different CS values based on simulated data.

- standarddeviation.py: Calculate the standard deviation of simulated data and estimated data over time for different CS and phi values.

- variance.py: Calculate the variance of simulated data and estimated data over time for different CS and phi values.
